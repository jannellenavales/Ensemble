    In the Philippines, when a woman turns 18, they come of age and celebrate with a “debut,” very similarly to a quinciñera or a “Sweet 16.” Of course, unless your family actually has money, many women don’t actually have one. 
</p>
<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    I’m not usually one for big parties, so when my mom announced I was having a debut, I secretly grumbled inside. I dreaded having to put on a fancy dress, having to put on a performance for other people, speaking to guests that didn’t really know me… but my mom was not one of those people who grew up with money. So, I let her live vicariously through the planning of my own celebration.
</p>
<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    Usually, the birthday celebrant plans a fun piece of their own, i.e. choreograph a dance with their friends or sing a song of their own. I decided to sing “Landslide” by Fleetwood Mac - I chose it because I felt it really fit my voice compared to other considerations, and I really resonated with the lyrics. I was getting older, changing, and growing into my own person… and I needed to be careful of the choices I made, unless I wanted to be brought down.
