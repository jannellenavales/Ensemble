    October 10, 2021<br><br>
    During senior year of undergrad, I was trying to branch out and meet new people to spice up what I believed would be an uneventful period of my life. Over the summer, I had enjoyed hiking in the Northeast, so I felt it might be good for me to set aside time each week to spend outdoors. Luckily for me, someone at my university had created a hiking group chat. The group went out every Sunday morning, which worked just fine with my schedule.
</p>
<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    The first time I went with the group, there were just four other students. The next time I went, however, we had a group of 15-20 people, and I only recognized one other person from the previous week. Despite my hesitance, I slowly mingled my way through the line our group had formed, while taking in the cool fall breeze and crunch of leaves beneath my feet. 
</p>
<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    While there were several individuals who I felt were incredibly easy to talk to, there was one person in particular that stood out to me the most. He was wearing these old fashioned glasses and a purple polo shirt, and I could hear his voice stand out from the others, even when I stood toward the back of line. I could tell he seemed well-spoken, if not a bit awkward - the first time he spoke to me, he made a comment about me looking too young to be a senior, which triggered a small defensive reaction and the need to put on a more closed demeanor. Nevertheless, he continued to ask me questions, and I came to the conclusion that he was a well-meaning person. 
</p>
<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    At one point, our group found ourselves on the top of a hill overlooking Lewisville Lake. As we descended, “purple shirt guy” had the idea of rolling down the hill. He could only roll half the way down and shreds of grass stuck to his clothes and hair by the end, but he didn’t seem to regret the experience. I thought his actions were a little outlandish and juvenile - but if doing so seemed to bring him joy, why should I complain? These are the moments we wish we were kids again… 
</p>

<p style="padding: 5px 25px 5px 25px">
    Anyways, “purple shirt guy” seems cool. He just asked me if I wanted to go see a movie for another one of his clubs; it’s too bad I have an event that day. Maybe another time, we can be good friends…
