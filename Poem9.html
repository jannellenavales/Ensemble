    April 23, 2023<br><br>
    It’s the end of the semester, and I’m feeling the pressure of the weight of my worries. All of the carefully created routines and habits I pushed myself to develop at the beginning of the semester have unraveled to the point of no immediate return… For example, I promised I’d come to every single class to stay up to date on the material. Now I’ve been skipping one of my classes to catch up with the others. It’s been so long that I’ve cooked a meal that I’m scared to touch the oven. I feel as if I’ve wasted my time frolicking with my friends, yet I haven’t been spending time with them as much as I should. After all, some of them will be gone in a few weeks or so, and who knows when I’ll see them again…

    I think about how much has changed since nearly a year ago. I was not nearly as busy as I was, yet I had a different sense of dread. Probably even more than the dread of deadlines that I currently have. I felt aimless, unsure of what the future would hold, both in terms of my professional and personal life. I’d spend hours of overthinking and agonizing over what seemed like nothing. At least now, I’m grateful to have a greater sense of direction. I have a large support system to rely on, even when I don’t realize it. You know the other day, my mother reached out to me. She had woken up at 5 in the morning, saying she had heard me call out to her, she had sensed my desperation… Now, I’m not one to believe in a higher power that facilitated this, but there are moments like these that made me question my beliefs. In this instance, I guess mother’s intuition is right…

    I know I’m rambling now, but I guess the point of this is to give myself a pep talk, to reassure myself that everything will be okay in the end. I’ve come to the realization that having low self-confidence has prevented me from achieving what I set out to do; however, the best thing I can do is try. There are others who are here for me and recognize my strengths, and I should always keep their thoughts in mind. And even if I make mistakes, I shouldn’t get too bent up over it, in fact, it might help to make fun of them…
